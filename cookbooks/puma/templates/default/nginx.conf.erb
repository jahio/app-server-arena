  # Server Names
  #
  # This is the list of IP's and/or domain names with any wildcards or
  # subdomains. The special value '_' is used to match all domains and IPs and
  # generally denotes the default server for the entire Nginx process.
  #
  # Note that if you specify any domains with wild cards, the very first domain
  # listed must be without a wild card. For example:
  #
  # server_name www.mydomain.org *.mydomain.org;
  #
  # It is good practice to include wildcard subdomains so that Nginx will not
  # require a restart when new services are added for an application.
  #

  #
  # SSL certificates
  #
  # Be sure that the directory and files are owned by and/or readable by the
  # Nginx user. Additionally, it is recommended that you do not use signed
  # certificates. The justification for this reocommendation is that in order to
  # start up the Nginx server the password will need to be typed in every time.
  # This precludes automatic/automated web server restarts on boot or otherwise.

  # This assigns the maximum accepted body size of client request. It is placed

  # it is here in case the application accepts large file uploads. In such a case
